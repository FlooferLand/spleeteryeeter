Simple command-line interface for Spleeter.

Asks you for the path of the file, amount of stems you need, and exports the stems.


## How to install
1. Install a Python version over 3.6 and under 3.8 and remember the exact path where you installed the version.
2. After installing Python type in `"(your_python_path)" -m pip install spleeter` in your terminal (your_python_path) being replaced by the path to Python 3.7.9
3. Download SpleeterYeeter, extract it somewhere, and  add in the path to Python 3.7.9 in `config.py`
4. Run `main.py` and type/paste in what it asks you to.

Stems are automagically exported to the `exports` directory in your extracted SpleeterYeeter

## All credit goes to Deezer for making Spleeter
SpleeterYeeter is just a wrapper of Spleeter, allowing you to use Spleeter more comfortably as you don't have to type in a long command that makes no sense.
