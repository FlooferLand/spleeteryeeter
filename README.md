Simple command-line interface for Spleeter.

Asks you for the path of the file, amount of stems you need, and exports the stems.

Stems are automagically exported to the `exports` directory in your extracted SpleeterYeeter

## How to install
Under the [Releases](https://github.com/flarfmatter/spleeteryeeter/releases) section there are pre-built Windows binaries available.

I would personally recommend going with the Python install below however if you just wish to use the tool without modifying it the binaries are a great choice.


1. Install a Python version over 3.6 and under 3.8 and remember the exact path where you installed the version.
2. After installing Python type in `(your_python_path) -m pip install spleeter` in your terminal (your_python_path) being replaced by the Python path
3. Download SpleeterYeeter, extract it somewhere, and add in the path to Python in `config.py`
4. Run `main.py` and type/paste in what it asks you to.

## How to build
SpleeterYeeter's binaries are built with [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe)

## All credit goes to Deezer for making Spleeter
SpleeterYeeter is just a wrapper of [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter), made so you could use Spleeter more comfortably.
